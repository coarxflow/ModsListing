For all the people tired of managing their growing number of mods, I came up with this little utility. It lets you save and restore the used mods at any point. Useful for linking a city with a set of mods and assets.

To use it, go to Content Manager -> Mods -> Mos Listing -> Options. From there, a save configuration from all the mods currently activated can be made. The configuration name can be chosen, so that it is easy to find it later and reload it.

The "Apply Now" button is a bit buggy. So it is better to choose the apply on restart option for the moment.

This mod uses the UIHelperExtended library from Klyte for a more advanced user interface.
